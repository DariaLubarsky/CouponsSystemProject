Coupon System Project
The coupon app is designed to manage a web shop for companies and shoppers. 
The system allows adding and editing products and seasonal sales, as well as following up with purchase statistics for companies.
Also, it allows purchasing products for shoppers and managing their profiles and preference. 
Moreover, the system tracks products and performs a daily routine to delete all expired deals.
